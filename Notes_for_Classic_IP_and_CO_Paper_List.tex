		\section{The Traveling-Salesman Problem and a Related Spanning-Tree Problem}
			\begin{definition}[1-tree]
				In graph $G = (V, E)$, where $V = \{1, 2, \cdots, n\}$, a 1-tree consists of a tree on the vertex set $\{2, 3, \cdots, n\}$, together with two distinct edges at vertex 1.
			\end{definition}

			Thus, a 1-tree has a single cycle, this cycle contains vertex 1 and vertex 1 always has degree 2. A minimal weighted 1-tree can be found by constructing a minimum spanning tree on the vertex set $\{2, 3, \cdots, n\}$, and then adjoining two edges of lowest weight at vertex 1.

			Also notice that every tour is a 1-tree, and a 1-tree is a tour iff each of its vertices has degree 2. If a minimum-weight 1-tree is a tour, it is the solution of the TSP.

			\begin{example} An example of 1-tree can be found in figure \ref{HKBound:1_tree}, solid arcs are minimum spanning tree of $\{2, 3, \cdots, n\}$ and two dashed arcs links the MST to vertex 1 with minimal cost.

			\begin{lemma}
				Let $\mathbf{\pi} = (\pi_1, \pi_2, \cdots, \pi_n)$ be a real $n$-vector. If $C^*$ is a minimum-weight tour with respect to the edge weights $c_{ij}$, then it is also a minimum-weight tour $C^\prime$ with respect to the edge weight $c_{ij} + \pi_i + \pi_j$.
			\end{lemma}

			\begin{proof}
				For tour $C$, the weight is $C = \sum_{(i, j) \in C} c_{ij}$. Therefore $C^\prime - C^* = 2 \sum_{i = 1}^n \pi_i$, which is a constant.
			\end{proof}

			Change the costs from $c_{ij}$ to $c_{ij} + \pi_i + \pi_j$ only changes its minimum spanning 1-tree. Introduce a gap function $f(\pi)$, which is the cost of a minimum-weight tour minus the cost of a minimum-weighted 1-tree both with respect to the weights $c_{ij} + \pi_i + \pi_j$. Notice that if $f(\pi) = 0$ then we found optimal tour for TSP, thus, we consider the problem of finding $\min_\pi f(\pi)$, where
			\begin{equation}
				f(\pi) =
